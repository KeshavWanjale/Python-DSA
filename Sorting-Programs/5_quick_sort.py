    Description:
        Another divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a "pivot" element, partitions the other elements into those less than and greater than the pivot, and recursively sorts the partitions.
        Time Complexity: O(n log n) on average, O(nÂ²) in the worst case.

        list
    Returns:
        Sorted list
